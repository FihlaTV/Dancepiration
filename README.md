## Dancepiration
This application called Dancepiration is part of a Master project at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The Master project is about support for choreographers by semi-automatic dance analysis and the generation of new creative elements.

### Usage
Within this application, users can add a choreography in three different dance styles. After entering a choreography, the user can get variations of choreographies on three different ways.
Each button creates a variation a different way. Furthermore, the user is able to select a particular dance step and get new suggestions for replacing that step.
